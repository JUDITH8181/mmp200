            <h2>Someone who treats addiction in Asheville, N.C.</h2>
            <p>Addiction does not discriminate. It is not only the "junkie" you see on the corner, begging for change who is affected. I've helped treat everyone from an Ivy League graduate from a prominent, well respected family, to an elderly Southern matriarch who became addicted after being prescribed opioids for years and has never even tried marijuana.</p>

            <h2>A former addict from Pittsburgh</h2>
            <p>The stories with hope attached to them. The stories where mothers and children are being reunited, the stories where women are standing on their own two feet and working towards goals and achieving them, the stories where that broke lost girl finds her way and makes it. These are the stories of hope, if you look hard enough they're on every corner... Advice? Never lose hope in a person with opiod abuse disorder.</p>

            <h2>Sarah who overcame her addiction</h2>
            <p>That it's a public/mental health disease, it's not about being a bad person or morally weak. I also want people to know that with proper long-term treatment it's possible to recover and live a beautiful life. I feel incredibly fortunate to have my recovery of almost 6 years and to have my life back.</p>

            <h2>Brittney who has been sober since 2014</h2>
            <p>I used to say, "I would never do that!" I would have the public knowâ€¦Don't judge. Never see yourself as someone who "would never." I started with prescribed Vicodin. I've been sober now seven years. Every day, I'm grateful for life itself. My mother died of overdose on October 12, 2007. I've seen hundreds die before their time. We have to help each other.</p>

            <h2>Jane from Chicago</h2>
            <p>Kicking the habit is very hard and painful. Then, to relearn how to live can be just as taxing. Find support wherever you can get it, as well as taking a lot of ownership for your own success and failure during recovery, and be sure to pat yourself on the back each day for successful days. Staying clean is an every day/life-long challenge but worth it.</p>

            <h2>James, brother or an addict.</h2>
            <p>It's heartbreaking and infuriating to see that someone you love is trapped in this hell that you cannot rescue them from. You just want to run in and scoop them up and whisk them away from their bad choices and unsafe lifestyle, but every time they seem to run back. I was able to convince my brother to seek help and he has been sober for 7 years.</p>
