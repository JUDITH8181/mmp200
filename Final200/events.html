            <h2>Addiction Family Support Group</h2>
              <p><b>Wednesday, May 2, 2018 - 7:00pm @ Far Rockaway, Queens.</b></p>
            <p>FAMILIES NEED SUPPORT TOO. When we think of treatment for addictions and other self-destructive behaviors, we tend to focus on the person with the problem. But if you’ve ever had a loved one that is struggling, you know in your heart that they’re not the only ones that need the help. Join a group of families who know what you’re going through and gain awareness on what you can do to help yourself, as well as the ones you love. You are not alone. There is help. NO FEE. NO JUDGEMENT. NO COMMITMENT.</p>

              <p><b>Saturday, May 19, 2018 - 9:00am to 12:00pm @ Corona, Queens.</b></p>
            <p>Shatterproof Rise Up Against Addiction 5K Walk/Run is a national movement. Families, friends, coworkers, and neighbors walk or run 5 kilometers to bring the disease of addiction into the light. Whether you've had a substance use disorder or have watched someone you care about struggle with this disease, join us to show that no one should ever suffer alone. Unite with other walkers and runners, supporting those who have lost a loved one to addiction and celebrating those who are living in recovery today. Every dollar you raise brings us one step closer to ending the devastation of addiction in America. Together, we will reduce the secrecy and remove the shame. Together, we will walk into the light and change the conversation about addiction.

            <h2>Spirituality in Recovery: The Many Paths to Spiritual Fitness</h2>
            <p><b>Tue, May 29, 2018 7:30 PM – 9:00 PM @ Ozone Park, Queens</b></p>
              <p>Spirituality in Recovery: The Many Paths to Spiritual Fitness will be presented by Jerry Fouchey, BS, MA, SpA, CADC; Dawn Farm Outpatient and Personal Medicine therapist. Twelve Step recovery programs challenge participants through the Eleventh Step to “seek through prayer and meditation to improve their conscious contact with God as they understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will and the power to carry that out.” The literature points out that recovering people have "tread innumerable paths" in this process. This presentation will encourage participants to clarify their personal understanding of a Higher Power, examine the quality of their relationship with that Power, and explore vehicles to build their conscious contact. Part of the Dawn Farm Education Series. Free, open to all, no registration required. Provides 1.5 hours of free C.E. for addiction professionals.</p>
